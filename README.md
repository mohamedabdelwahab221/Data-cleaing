Description: Conducted a data cleaning project involving SQL to practice and enhance skills in data cleaning and data importing processes. The project focused on cleaning and preparing data for analysis in a MySQL database environment.

Objectives and Goals:

Objectives: Practice and refine data cleaning techniques, and understand the data importing process.
Goals: Successfully clean and import data into a MySQL database, ensuring accuracy and consistency.
Role and Responsibilities:

Designed and executed SQL queries to identify and clean data anomalies.
Imported raw data into MySQL and performed data transformation.
Created scripts to automate repetitive data cleaning tasks.
Process and Approach:

Data Analysis: Examined the raw data for inconsistencies, missing values, and duplicates.
Cleaning Techniques: Applied SQL queries to remove duplicates, fill missing values, and standardize data formats.
Import Process: Used MySQL tools and commands to import data and integrate it into the database.
Challenges and Solutions:

Challenge: Encountered a high volume of inconsistent and duplicate data.
Solution: Developed SQL scripts to systematically clean the data and validate the results, ensuring data integrity.
Outcome and Results:

Successfully cleaned and imported data into MySQL.
The project highlighted that the provided data was fake or not real; however, it served as effective practice material for data cleaning techniques.
Gained hands-on experience in handling real-world data cleaning challenges.
Skills and Tools Used:

Skills: SQL query writing, data cleaning, data importing, database management.
Tools: MySQL Workbench, SQL scripts.
Visuals and Supporting Materials:

SQL Scripts: Link to SQL scripts
Before and After Data Snapshots: Include screenshots showing raw data vs. cleaned data.
Feedback and Testimonials:

This project was a valuable learning experience, providing practical insights into data cleaning processes and SQL application.
Conclusion: The project enhanced my skills in SQL-based data cleaning and importing. Despite the data being fake, the experience provided practical knowledge and improved my ability to handle data cleaning tasks in a database environment.
